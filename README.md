# DSA Project Repository

This repository contains three files for a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project. Follow the instructions below to use these files:

1. **Files:**
   - `DSA_Project_Matrix_Generation.py`: Python script to generate an output file called `array.txt`.
   - `DSA_Idea.c`: C program to process `array.txt` and generate `output_file.txt`.
   - `DSA_Project_Data_Visualisation.py`: Python script to visualize data from `output_file.txt`.

2. **Setup:**
   - **Download the Image File:** Before running any code, download the image file required for processing.

3. **Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Run `DSA_Project_Matrix_Generation.py` with the image file in the same folder. This will generate `array.txt`.
   - **Step 2:** Run `DSA_Idea.c` with `array.txt` in the same folder. This will generate `output_file.txt`.
   - **Step 3:** Run `DSA_Project_Data_Visualisation.py` with `output_file.txt` in the same folder. This will generate plots to visualize data.

4. **Note:**
   - Ensure that all files are kept in the same folder while running the scripts.
   - Modify the code as needed for specific requirements or file paths.
